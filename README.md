- ## Abstract
  Recently, language models (LMs) have achieved significant performance on many NLU tasks, which has spurred widespread interest for their possible applications in the scientific and social area. However, LMs have faced much criticism of whether they are truly capable of reasoning in NLU. In this work, we propose a diagnostic method for first-order logic (FOL) reasoning with a new proposed benchmark, LogicNLI. LogicNLI is an NLI-style dataset that effectively disentangles the target FOL reasoning from commonsense inference and can be used to diagnose LMs from four perspectives: accuracy, robustness, generalization, and traceability. Experiments on BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, have uncovered the weaknesses of these LMs on FOL reasoning, which motivates future exploration to enhance the reasoning ability.

- ## Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a diagnostic method to diagnose LMs’ FOL reasoning ability. This method introduces a novel proposed benchmark, LogicNLI, that disentangles the FOL reasoning from commonsense inference. Specifically, it includes four evaluations to measure the FOL reasoning ability from different perspectives. Results on three LMs show that although some LMs (RoBERTa) own a certain interpretable FOL reasoning ability, they still cannot make sensible FOL reasoning like humans. Detailed analysis motivates us to enhance specific reasoning abilities or explore new methods to make neural models understand more refined logic.
